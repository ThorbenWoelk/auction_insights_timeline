Plotting a Timeline from AdWords Auction Insights Data
======================================================

This R code snippet allows to plot a timeline from Google AdWords Auction Insights data.
In order to make it run smoothly, please follow the guidelines below.

1. The following packages have to be installed using the `install.packages()` command in your R console:  
- readr
- ggplot2
- scales
- dplyr

2. In order to set your own brand as a reference category in the plot, adjust all rows where the comment says `##### REPLACE "CHANEL" WITH YOUR BRAND NAME HERE`.

3. And that should do it! Run the code (e.g. in RStudio) and see if the PDF output is correctly created.
In case you want to adjust on the size of the plot, you can adjust it in the line where the comment tells you to.
